    <h2>Hi <span role='img' aria-label='Waving hand'>üñê</span></h2>
    <p>I am Pawe≈Ç and I am currently studying at the Silesian University of Technology. I have been creating websites and working as a freelancer since I graduated from a technical college.</p>
    <p>Recently I have decided that it is the right time to start my first decent job in the IT industry, preferably as a junior front-end developer. As a result I motivated myself to learn React.JS as an extension of my current knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
    <p>On a daily basis I am interested in motorization and volleyball. I am a communicative person, with high interpersonal skills and problem solving mindset. I would consider myself a strong team player, focused on constant development.</p>
