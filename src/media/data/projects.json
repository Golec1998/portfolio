This application, written in Kotlin, initially was created as a final project for Mobile Application Programming assigment that was given during the 5th semester of my studies.|In the mean time, I have came to the conclusion that developing web version of this project would be a perfect field to gain experience in working with React.JS.|In the future, I am planing to write the entire application from scratch to adapt its structure according to events organizers feedback, and to give them the ability to add events on their own.",
